1st prototype:

start with backpack, rope, a potion or two, torches and a voucher for weapon at smithy, tasked to ascend through 
the hold to the summit of the mountain for artifact that the duke wants

option to talk to book keeper who is obsessed with the dwarves who used to inhabit the hold 
to obtain knowledge of the hold (required to progress)

move to smithy for first weapon, smithy also hands you explosives in case you get stuck

head down into the cave to bridge to the hold, explosives needed to blast open the steel door

hold not as abandoned as first thought infested with squatter goblins > defeat goblins

knowledge of book keeper required to advance towards the lifting platforms to the top, can backtrack if not done
at first, find skeleton key 

ascend into temple where hobgoblins reside > big battle

use skeleton key to open chest obtain artifact

go down mountain side with ropes to return to duke and hand him the artifact
