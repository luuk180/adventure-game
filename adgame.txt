1st prototype:

start with backpack, rope, a potion or two, torches and a voucher for weapon at smithy, tasked to ascend through 
the hold to the summit of the mountain for artifact that the duke wants

option to talk to book keeper who is obsessed with the dwarves who used to inhabit the hold 
to obtain knowledge of the hold [he will tell you how to read certain runes] (required to progress)

move to smithy for first weapon, smithy also hands you explosives in case you get stuck and tells you about that if
you return some goblin contraptions he will reward you handsomly (boon to make the hobgoblin fight more trivial)

head down into the cave to bridge to the hold, explosives needed to blast open the steel door

hold not as abandoned as first thought infested with squatter goblins > defeat goblins, find traces
of hobgoblin a bigger and more powerful goblin,

knowledge of book keeper required to advance towards the lifting platforms to the top, can backtrack if not done
at first puzzle here will have a story in the runes which will corrospond with your options, and need to be done in
a certain order, obtain skeleton key and access to the top

ascend into temple where hobgoblins reside > big battle

use skeleton key to open chest obtain artifact also find dwarven books for book keep

go down mountain side with ropes to return to duke and hand him the artifact
